##1. Objects
- Key: Opens any hinged door with a pin tumbler lock and turns it into a portal to the Lost Room. From the room, the user can exit to any location of their choosing provided that location has a door of similar construction.
- Pen: The ballpoint tip instantly microwaves any subject upon contact. This results in severe trauma and often death in living subjects. Additionally, the pen has been known to launch its victims away with the force of a cannon. This microwave burst can also be used to short circuit electronics.
- Bus Ticket: When the Bus Ticket is touched to a person's skin, that person is transported to **U.S. Route 66** outside Gallup, New Mexico the town where the Sunshine Motel is found.
- Nail File: Induces a brief, but deep sleep when light reflects off its surface into the subject's eyes.
- Comb: Stops time for the user when the comb is run through the user's hair, but only for 10 subjective seconds (according to the official website, the comb cannot be used by somebody who is bald). 
- Glass eye: Can restore (heal) or destroy all flesh. Must be inside the eyesocket of the wearer to function. Purported to be the most powerful of the weaponized Objects. 
- Scissors: Rotates targeted items in three dimensional space. The axis of the rotation can be either inside or outside the target. Human sized objects appear to be easily affected. Affecting larger objects appears to require more effort. 
- Watch box: Dampens entropy for 10 meters. In layman's terms, it prevents things from decaying. 
- Deck of Cards: Induces startling visions relating to the Sunshine Motel in people who see the faces of the playing cards, which can be used to temporarily incapacitate victims. 
- Quater: Bring life to memories for a short time, 2or 3 days

- Cufflink: Lowers blood pressure of wearer, but might possibly be a placebo effect. 
-Newspaper: The Newspaper will open up when a certain tone is played and close up when a different tone is played (it is unknown what tones are required).
- Pencil: Creates a 1961 US penny when the eraser tip is tapped against a solid surface.

##2. Charactors

- Detective Joe Miller – A Pittsburgh detective who stumbles upon the existence of the Room. When his daughter becomes lost inside the Room, Joe sets out to get her back by using the Key to track down other Objects.
- Anna Miller – Joe's 8-year-old daughter. Her disappearance is seen by others as a probable family abduction by Joe in an ongoing child custody battle with his (unseen) ex-wife, Vanessa.
- Detective Lou Destefano – Joe's partner, whose murder in the story is blamed on Joe.
- Detective Lee Bridgewater – Joe's friend at the police department. She is trying to clear Joe's name, and in so doing slowly discovers the powers held by the Room and its Objects.
- Dr. Martin Ruber – A forensic scientist who works with Joe and who becomes obsessed with the Objects, going as far as killing in an attempt to get the Key. Through his obsession, he learns of and joins the Order of the Reunification, a cabal that believes the Objects are pieces of God and will allow direct communication with God if reunited as they were at the time of the Event. By the end of the series, Ruber believes he has become the Prophet of the Objects after having a vision while staring at the Polaroid Object.
- Jennifer Bloom – A member of the Legion, another cabal dedicated to finding all of the Objects and hiding them for the protection of humanity. Jennifer tries to warn Joe of the inherent danger of the Room and the Objects therein. Her brother, Drew, became obsessed with the Objects, and Jennifer believes that something in Room 9 of the Motel "destroyed" him.
- Karl Kreutzfeld – A former member of the Legion and collector of Objects. He owns a chain of dry-cleaning stores and several pawnshops that he uses to acquire Objects. Kreutzfeld claims to be searching for the Glass Eye to cure his son Isaac's leukemia. Alternately an ally and an enemy to Joe.
- Wally Jabrowski – A man who has the Bus Ticket and is effectively a drifter. He has extensive knowledge about the Objects and their history.
- Harold Stritzke – A voyeur who inherited the Comb from his aunt Barbara, a member of the Collectors. He has become very paranoid after being pursued by the Order and others who want his Object for themselves.
- Howard "The Weasel" Montague – A former philosophy professor turned small-time criminal. He's an obsessed collector of Objects who charts the Objects' relations to one another and introduces the idea of the Prime Object.
- Milton Vrang – A former member of a Cabal and only living burn victim of the Pen. He provides valuable and secret information to Dr. Martin Ruber on the mysterious and dangerous world of Objects and Object Seekers.
- Suzie Kang – A tough, chain-smoking, independent operator who works as an Object tracker, selling information about the locations of the Room's Objects. She never touches them, as she recognizes the dangers that the Objects carry. Suzie runs her Object-tracking business out of the back of her mother's dry-cleaning business. She charges a fortune for the information.
- The Sood – A seedy, Las Vegas-based dealer of Object "Science" – pictures, videos, and artifacts relating to Objects – but never Objects themselves.
- Anthony – The intimidating bodyguard, hitman, and head of Kreutzfeld's personal Secret Service-style security team.
- Pumeet – The Sood's ubiquitous manservant and bodyguard.
- The Occupant, formerly Eddie McCleister – The Occupant was removed from time and space during The Event that made the Lost Room, leaving only his personal belongings as "Objects". Eddie no longer exists in time and there is no memory of his ever doing so, as even his wife has no recollection of him. He resides in a sanitarium under the name "John Doe" until found by Joe. Like the objects, he does not age, and cannot be damaged (hurt) in any way, so he himself is essentially one of the objects.
- Ignacio "Iggy" Loca – Survivor of the pawn shop murders, temporarily holder of the Key, hands it to Detective Miller when dying.

##3. Cabals
Many Object-seekers have organized themselves into groups, known as "cabals". Wars between cabals are mentioned in the series. There are at least three cabals:

- The Collectors 
The original group of Object-seekers formed some time after the Event. Led by Arlene Conroy, the manager of the Sunshine Motel, most of the Collectors were killed or driven insane after the disaster in Room 9 in 1966. The survivors hid their most important Objects in a place called "The Collector's Vault", buried in a fallout shelter beneath an abandoned prison.
- The Legion 
A cabal dedicated to collecting the Objects and stopping them from causing more harm. They claim to follow an established set of rules, including that they never kill in order to acquire the Objects, although this rule is sometimes put to the test.
- The Order of the Reunification 
Also referred to as "The Order" or "The New Religion". They believe that the Objects are pieces of God and must be reunited. Once so restored, members of the Order would be able to communicate with God for the first time in human history. Unlike the Legion, The Order have no qualms about killing. 

##3. Keywords
- The Event: It occurred at 1:20:44 p.m. on May 4, 1961, and erased the room and all of its contents from history.
- Conservation of Objects: When the Objects are within the Room, they return to their original state as harmless items and can be destroyed in that state. Any Object destroyed while in the Room, according to the Occupant, is replaced by another similar object, in accordance with the law of conservation of matter.
- The Conroy Experiment: Performed by Arlene Conroy, the experiment used the Clock, the Nail Clippers, the Cigarette pack, the Ashtray, the Toothbrush, the Watch Box,  and of course the Key.  Karl’s experiment also used the Quarter and the eye.
