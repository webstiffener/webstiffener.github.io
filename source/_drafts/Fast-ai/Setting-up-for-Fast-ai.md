Tips on setting up your computer for Fast.ai courses on both Windows and Ubuntu
===================================================

**>> LAST UPDATED JANUARY, 2018 <<**

**I strictly followed the fast.ai wiki installation guide, but didn't get it work, then I spent a lot of time on solving all kinds of problems and finally got it done. So I decide to write down what I did differently, hoping that it might help someone to get through this pain in the ass process.**

# Windows 10

The wiki recommended [this guide](https://github.com/philferriere/dlwin), which is great and thorough. However, in order to make it work for the fast.ai courses, a few things have to be changed.

1. Unzip the VS2015 installation file before install it, or you might get a "missing package" error or something like that, although you can solve it by copying the `packages` folder from the .zip file to the missing directory.

2. Install Anaconda with python2.7 as Fast.ai recommended, however install a python3.6 version is not a problem, just remember to use `conda create --name dlwin27 python=2.7` when you create your deep learning environment.

3. Do rememer to `activate dlwin27` before installing any python packages, or you will install it to the main conda environment instead of dlwin27.

4. I changed some packages' version, because the guide's version didn't work for me , you should install like `conda -y pygpu==0.7.5 theano==1.0.1 keras==1.2.2`. Also you might want to install the following packages before starting lesson 1.
```Shell
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
conda install -y PIL
pip install sklearn
conda install -y bcolz
conda install -c menpo ffmpeg
conda install -y h5py
```
5. If your `keras.json` file has a line like `"image_data_format": "channels_last"`, it could be that you installed a higher version keras like 2.0.5. Uninstall it with `conda uninstall keras==2.0.5` and install version 1.2.2, then change the content in `keras.json` to
```json
{
    "floatx": "float32",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "backend": "theano",
    "image_dim_ordering": "th"
}
```
6. In order to use cuDNN acceleration, you will need a GPU with compute capability higher than 3.0, otherwise it will ignore the cuDNN flag and use GPU only. Check your GPU's compute capability [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). 

7. Installing TensorFlow or CNTK is not necessary for Fast.ai courses.

8. Do validate your installation using `cpu_gpu_test.py` as suggested in the guide.

# Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

1. I have changed the original [install-gpu.sh](https://github.com/fastai/courses/blob/master/setup/install-gpu.sh) file to [install-gpu-ws.py](https://github.com/webstiffener/Learning_fastai/blob/master/setup/install-gpu-ws.sh), because it didn't work for me.

2. For some reason, the original script always installs CUDA-9.1, so I used `sudo apt-get -y install cuda-8.0` instead. I also add extra system variables, see line 27~30 in [install-gpu-ws.py](https://github.com/webstiffener/Learning_fastai/blob/master/setup/install-gpu-ws.sh).

3. You will have to install the following python packages before starting lesson 1, pay attention to the package version.
```Shell
conda install -y pygpu==0.6.2 theano==0.9.0 keras==1.2.2 mkl-service==1.1.2 h5py==2.7.0
conda install -y matplotlib pandas
pip install sklearn
conda install -y bcolz
conda install -c menpo ffmpeg
```

4. My `.theanorc` file is a little different from the original script, use `device = cpu` when you want to use the CPU mode.
```
[global]
device = cuda0
floatX = float32

[cuda]
root = /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin
```

5. Remember to install git using `sudo apt-get --assume-yes install git`, because the last part of the script will use git to clone the course repository.

6. **THE MOST IMPORTANT THING**. Notice that line 25 in `install-gpu-ws.py`should output something like following, or it means your nvidia drive is not properly installed.

![nvidia-smi](https://github.com/webstiffener/Learning_fastai/raw/master/setup/nvidia-smi.png)

To solve this problem you have to manually install the Nvidia drive. 
First, remove cuda and the nvidia drive installed previously.

```Shell
sudo apt-get remove nvidia*
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

Then download the Nvidia drive .run file suitable for your GPU from [here](http://www.nvidia.cn/Download/index.aspx), and remember where you put it. Use the following code to block and backup the ubuntu default drive file `/lib/modules/4.10.0-42-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau.ko`, notice you might have more than one `x.xx.x-xx-generic` folder, block them all. 

```Shell
sudo mv /lib/modules/4.10.0-42-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau.ko /lib/modules/4.10.0-42-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau.ko.org
```

Reboot and execute `lsmod | grep nouveau`, the default drive is successfully blocked if there is no output. Use `sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop` to enter system command mode, press Ctrl + Alt +F1 to login the system. (I use "root" as my login name and **sudo password** as my login password. **DO NOT USE THE NUMBER KEYBOARD TO ENTER YOUR PASSWORD**)
`cd` to where you download the drive .run file and run it.

```Shell
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.20.run
```
When asked about `opengl-files` or `X configuration` or `nouveau check`, **CHOOSE NO**. Reboot and execute `nvidia-smi`, you should expect something like the image mentioned above.
Then download and install [CUDA 8.0.61](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive), after running the .run file you will have to read a super long text, just press ENTER until it gets 100%.

![download CUDA-8.0.61](https://github.com/webstiffener/Learning_fastai/raw/master/setup/download%20cuda-8.0.61.png)

Choose like following and contitue the rest steps.
```

Last advice, be patient. I am only a rookie coder and I made it, so will you, much serious challenges are waiting for us. By the way, [Forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) and website like Stackoverflow are excellent places to look for help.

Good luck.
